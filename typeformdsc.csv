My Teammates and myself need to run many SQL updates on Live servers and sometimes it is under
some pressure, this lead to a few costly mistakes.
So I introduced a more structured process that when these updates get executed on a Live DB what it actually does, is:
1) Creates an Backup at the default SQL installation path
2) the .mdf file gets swapped out with the Live
3) the updates gets placed into a SQL Catch Statements and if no Error are detected it provides a success messages
4) If there are errors then the Live .mdf files gets swapped back, so in essence the scripts never really gets executed on the Live.

For some reason I really need to prove over and over that it would be a better process but it finally cam through.","I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",1,1,1,2,1,"I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","

He suffered a massive heart attack, and I had to now think of what the next steps in my life would be.

I had to start life over again without him -- instantly -- but also now as a new me. It was hard, but I did it -- without therapy or medication. I saw life differently. It was more fragile, and my values changed. I listened more. I observed more. I was more patient, respectful, and forgiving.  And I started to become kinder to myself.

Though I didn't start my coding journey until 7 years later, I was able to do because I was a changed person.

I'm sure you wanted to read about persevering when encountering a coding error or bug, but hey, the question was open ended. And I think that what goes on in our personal lives has a strong effect on our professional lives as well.

",,"10-14 hours/week","I feel that, compared to my peers, I have always needed to put in more effort to get to my destination. I believe the reason for this is that I did not have any role models in my life growing up; I have had to figure out and navigate a lot on my own. I lost my mother when I was six and my father could barely handle his own problems with drug addiction, essentially leaving me to fend for myself. I look back now and am amazed that I was able to not only graduate high school, but also graduate from a challenging university. Although it was tough, I would never take back those experiences and hardships because it left me with this innate drive to always improve upon myself and my situation. I have overcome a lot of obstacles in my short life—and I plan on overcoming more—but I know my perseverance is one of the stronger traits that I possess. Even into my adulthood I am still striving to reach higher and go further, and I continually seek out opportunities that will allow me to reach my destination.","I sometimes write code to solve problems in my work.",2,2,3,2,2,"I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","It was while I was being pushed into a sales position that I realized I wanted to figure out what I   wanted to do for my career.  Previously I had received a bachelor’s degree in Political Science   and thought I would be on my way to law school.  But after the experience of my friends I knew   that the lawyer lifestyle was not for me.  So instead I rang potential customers for hours each   day until I began to think that there had to be an easier way.  The standard method in our sales   office was to work off of a call sheet with company names and contacts that had not been   updated in years.  But rather than following the crowd and endlessly getting hung up on and told   that I had the wrong number, I decided to find some better data to work from.  Within a day’s   time I taught myself how to run queries on the office’s outdated AS-­‐400 computer software.  My   thought was to focus my searches on current customers who received one product or service   from us, but not a complementary product.  For example, customers who rented mops and   buckets but not cleaning chemicals.  Or customers who rented shirts as part of their company   uniform but not pants.  By doing these simple queries I was able to significantly increase the   appointments of our sales reps, and consequently our sales for that quarter.  It was at this point   that I learned how much I valued using data to achieve a business function.  When I began   spending more time running queries and managing my own personal database than making   sales calls, I knew it was time for me to move on.
So I took a leap of faith; I quit my job, I started to take classes at night, and I even delivered pizza in order to pay the bills. But within year I had completed enough coursework and a Microsoft bootcamp to catch the eye of a local consulting firm. For the past two years I have worked on small and large projects that implement CRM systems for large manufacturing companies. By far my favorite aspect of the job is working with data, but this is few and far between. I do a good amount of ETL work and even work with some middleware services to integrate systems, and while these are good skills to learn, they are not getting me to the ultimate goal of becoming a data scientist. During my current job I have been taking coursework for a master’s degree in Information Systems from Dakota State University. It was the coursework in data mining and predictive analytics that have really shown me that becoming a data scientist is where I have been heading all along. I think there is so much good that can be done with our vast amount of data in this world, and I want to be one of those making a difference!

I wanted it to be a practical data product that created real-world value.  For the project, I scraped a dataset of historical UFC (professional mixed martial arts) fights, and developed a predictive model.  In total I spent close to 4 months wrangling and cleaning data, testing the model, adjusting the model, then testing and adjusting again... all of this work being done alone (with some guidance from my excellent mentor, Goran).  Today, I've been using the UFC data product to bet on UFC fights every week since September, and it's producing consistent financial returns.  I've also recruited my brother (a software developer), and another friend (product scientist at Medium) to further assess betting strategies through Monte Carlo simulations, as well as to further automate the weekly dataset updates and upcoming fight predictions.","I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",2,3,2,2,2,"I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","In a word, it's enjoyable.  I originally studied CS in college before changing majors, and have continued to code on a hobbyist level ever since (rails, python, arduino).  So, in a way, this represents me coming back to an activity I've enjoyed all along, and realizing I'd be pretty happy doing this for a living.  But more than just coding, data science is a powerful and flexible way to combine an interest in writing code with any number of personal interests in other subject areas - I'm doing it right now with my UFC project (I'm not only an avid UFC sports fan, but I practice Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu, and even compete from time to time).  In fact, I'm doing it on a third level with the UFC project by taking an alternative investment approach to the fund management and betting strategies (after business school, I worked at a small cybersecurity seed fund, which is a form of alternative investment). 

I have other interests, of course, and I'm excited to see how I can apply data insights to those too - professionally and personally.","2016-11-14 16:10:54","2016-11-14 17:21:36",90cfdd4983

PROJECTS WORKED:

Communication Accounting System for Telecom Billing System [CAS Liberty]
Client: Highland Lakes software                                                       7 months.
Brief Description:
CAS Liberty is a basically telecom billing system. We finally generate bills using CAS System for each call made by the customer. While billing we rate the each call and we apply various taxes, various discounts based on the services, based on peak hours, based on billing cycles. CAS System takes the input as files generated by hardware devices [switches and servers]. The input file contains call detail information. The files generated by hardware devices are in different format. We take those files and format them into a universal format that CAS understands. After formatting we will get call details records which we will store in one of the Tables. We rate call using CAS rate tables and rate codes. Once rating is done, we apply various taxes and discounts for that call. We store all of the information in database. We fetch it to generate reports and invoices [Bills for each customer].

1ac7d027e6cfdfea7553274cbf3698f4,Matthew,Worley,mworles@gmail.com,1-609-462-2076,,"January 2nd, 2017",0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjworley,,"15-20 hours/week","In my first year of fellowship after receiving my PhD, I submitted my first major application for a federal research grant. My proposal received good scores that fell slightly short of the marks for award, but it had promising odds of funding if I submitted a revised proposal to respond to critiques. However, the review process is subjective and at times unpredictable, and the revised proposal unexpectedly received a worse review. In combination with decreased federal research budgets, my project was now unlikely to be funded for the foreseeable future. Because my proposed faculty job at UCLA depended on this funding, my job was very much in doubt. This was a frustrating situation after spending nearly 7 years in graduate school and fellowship with the goal of acquiring a faculty job. 

To hedge against this possible outcome, I had begun networking with colleagues at other universities about my research and opportunities to collaborate or join their groups. After receiving the unfavorable news on my grant proposal, I stepped up my efforts to pitch my research ideas and market my unique skills and interests in statistics, hoping to land job offers elsewhere. These efforts led to two competing offers, and I accepted a faculty position with a role in statistical analysis and data management for a group of researchers at UC San Diego. 

Even though I was now at a different university, I continued to push for my proposal to get funded, as this would be the first building block in establishing my own research program. To overcome the barriers created by my move to a new university, I pursued many phone meetings with busy administrators at the funding agency, acquired new mentors at my new university, and retooled my proposal to argue my project would be strengthened by my new institution. My proposal was ultimately funded, nearly 2 years after the original submission. ","I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",2,3,2,1,1,"I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.","I have always been fascinated with questions of “why”, such as learning the underlying reasons why people make certain decisions or why certain events happen. This instinct led me to a PhD in psychology and a research career to identify the underlying causes of self-defeating human behavior, like substance abuse. However, unlike many researchers who learn basic statistics and then outsource their data work to others, data analysis is my favorite aspect of the research process, and one that I cannot envision giving up. For me, data analysis is the core of research, because data is the only evidence we have to test our ideas or answer our questions. In a sense, the data is all that matters. Unlike most researchers, I’m more obsessed with improving my technical skills than in becoming an expert in a particular field or topic. Data science fits this trait as it provides an endless domain for mastery of new techniques and innovating new approaches to solve data-related problems. For me, the most stimulating task I encounter in my job is being presented with a new question about data, and having to design a creative way to approach the data to answer the question. This is a secondary or occasional task in my job as a researcher, but will become my primary role when working as a data scientist. 

My decision to leave academia to pursue data science is also motivated by differences in the purpose of data in these respective fields. In academia data often isn’t used with an actionable goal in mind. Data produced by research studies are typically published in journals that are consumed mainly by other researchers, and data rarely drive actions at the clinic or patient level. In contrast, practical data science is more often used to provide an actionable recommendation. In reviewing the typical roles of data scientists, I desire such an action-oriented role where data have more immediate impact for guiding an action. In academia I also find that ingrained conventions or theories are deeply resistant to change even when confronted with conflicting data. Scientists go to great lengths to “bend” the data to fit their original hypothesis or idea. I prefer a career where data is used more objectively as feedback for nimble adjustment of a process or goal. Data science is also used in a way that creates value for an organization, a decision-maker, or a consumer. My work in academia has lacked this emphasis on adding value, which I see as a more satisfying use of data and a necessary component of my career.","2016-11-16 23:41:18","2016-11-16 23:43:00",ff0772bfda

We had piggybacked on systems designed for customer support/service for commercial computer customers that did not -- and could not -- capture the nature of the problems our retail customers were experiencing. Also, our products had unique issues, mostly a result of choices made to meet necessary retail pricepoints.

As if that were not enough, we had little budget to improve or develop new systems.

I attacked this, mostly working solo, by developing and reporting the best metrics possible given the information we had. I reached out to our partners (mostly Intel and Microsoft) to figure out what data they had to to understand how to best use what we collectively had available. Over time, as reporting of metrics because more automated, and began to be seen as valuable, I was able to make room for a couple of interns to help build more of what was needed. I became an expert on the existing customer service systems and adapted them to better capture information necessary. With the interns we built more metrics and reports.

Three years later, I left due to organizational change, but I left it much better, with actual data-based metrics for quality and customer experiences, which outlasted my time there and that had been adopted in other segments of the business.","I sometimes write code to solve problems in my work.",3,1,3,1,2,"I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","To spend more time using statistics and numerical methods to address business problems.

I spent two weeks in a coma, one week in intensive care, and two weeks in brain recovery. During my therapy, I was asked to compute the integral of  with respect to xI instantly replied, “”  I had retained my long-term memory, but problem-solving became a larger mental hurdle than I could have imagined.  When I was rolled into my brain injury program, my exercises for physical therapy were simple compared to my problems for speech therapy.

         These questions were surprisingly difficult because I thought I could still solve the problems of advanced math competitions.  My analytic overconfidence was further inflated when I helped my fellow brain injury patients with board games.  This was until I rolled my wheelchair to a patient-accessible computer to view one of my former online problem-solving accounts.  I chose to not view my previous solutions, because I thought I could again solve these problems.  I was stunned by the difficulty of the questions while consciously remembering having solved them with ease.  Before viewing what I had previously posted, I concluded that if my long effort was now unfruitful, the solution must show that the answer just does not exist; however, the clever manipulation of pre-calculus tools performed by my former self swiftly ended my overconfident fantasy.

         I was struck by humility and benediction.  My mother, a high school math teacher, never left my side.  She patiently motivated me to overcome my redefined mental endowment.  I was able to re-learn how to logically understand problems by exercising mnemonic devices and other memory techniques. After a few days of fast re-development, I was rolling out of the brain recovery unit to begin the school year at home.

         My time in home school was expedited.  The one visit from my home instructor was rearranged so that I was able to explain the concept of a limit and how it defines the derivative of functions in order to provide the home mentor with his long-desired understanding of calculus.

          My time in emergency care and brain recovery showed me how often young men and women do not continue their lives after traumatizing accidents.  Learning of this reality with grieving families transformed my thankful rejoicing to painful questioning.  What right did I have to survive such a severe head trauma? 

         During my time as a patient, the one thing I remember wanting the most was to apply my mathematical ability to provide the greatest benefit to future generations.  I realized that my life’s passion is to provide opportunity for others via mathematics.  I will utilize my talent for teaching others how to have fun with mathematics, regardless of their preconceived feelings about math.

However, I've reached a point where I feel that biomedical engineering, and medicine in general, needs a new forcing function. This thought occurred when I was at a conference for personalized medicine and saw great opportunity in creating devices that adapt to not only patient, but also the physician. However, there are problems with this vision that I think data science can solve.
First, the value provided by patient-specific devices and medicines is hard to determine, but a little less hard with more data. This is a non-linear, multivariate, problem that will change how we apply medicine, from treatment of complex acute diseases in the developed world, to the treatment of people in developing countries. Second, the cost of medicine in countries like the USA are so random and unregulated, that it's no wonder that the USA has the highest spend on healthcare per capita than any other nation, but with less than average outcomes. 
Those are professional reasons. Personally, I have known that my kryptonite as an engineer has been complex coding projects. I've developed code that's worked well enough, or had my hand held to the finish line, but now I really want to dive deep into making applications and programs on my own, and in teams. I feel like I'm pretty dangerous with my engineering background in maths and sciences, but I could be much more effective with great coding skills.

Starting my new position as a Sales Consultant at a Toyota Dealership I was determined to do more. Once the position of Internet Sales Manager was open I jumped on it.

",1,"15-20 hours/week","As a Software Engineer, perseverance is a daily necessity. Often I will be presented with an issue that seems like a simple problem on the surface but underneath the surface is a complicated web of dependencies, business logic and assumptions. Most recently, the team I am working with has been tasked with fixing a data integrity issue in two of our analytics dashboards. What we began thinking would be a simple front-end issue where the data points weren't properly being plotted on graphs, etc. We later came to discover that micro-services in our data pipeline, which consists of projections from a relational database into Apache Kafka topics and subsequently Elastic Search documents, were incorrectly processing messages in between Kafka and Elastic Search. What started out as a small story on our product backlog has turned into several month long effort of diagnosing, fixing and validating several micro-services with no end in sight. Without perseverance my team would not have been able to uncover the underlying issue in our system and the business would have continued to suffer from a lack of user confidence in our data.","[Significant] I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",2,2,3,3,2,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I have always approached problems with an analytical mindset. As a child it started with strategic board games and Legos. As I progressed through school it matured into an affinity for STEM courses, specifically math, statistics and computer science. After school I was able to apply what I had learned in real-world scenarios as a software engineer. Through courses and professional experience I have grown an appreciation of algorithms, processing at scale, analyzing data and presenting findings that benefit the decision making ability of those around me. Finding unanswered questions and their answers has been the fundamental driving force behind my progression from childhood to software engineer. Recently my focus has shifted from asking and answering questions about a specific person or event to asking questions about people and a collection of events. With an understanding of data science fundamentals and the guidance of a mentor I believe that I will know how to answer those questions. There are a lot of programs out there that provide the learning tools but Springboard is one of the only programs that provides a mentor. A previous boss of mine once told me, ""If you want to do something, I should have to stop you from doing it."" Becoming a data scientist is something that I want to do and Springboard provides a structured way to accomplish that goal. While I would very much like to be a part of Springboard's successful story, one way or another I will become a data scientist.","2016-12-13 17:52:11","2016-12-13 20:07:25",38f43ff1ce

I've always been a lazy, preferring to read than ride my bike or ""play outside."" Despite this, mentally, I had a goal in the back of my mind to be able to run for 30 minutes. After going to the park at 10pm and running for 10-15 minutes, I got over the shame of my lack of fitness and started running during the day, eventually reaching 20 minutes. Then after a few more months, I reached 30. 
I've kept up the running. On and off, but consistently, and nowadays I'll run for an hour or so. At this point I'm thinking about half-marathon goals. Eventually I'd like to run a full marathon.
I'm still fairly lazy, although much less than before, but I'm consistent. I know that I'll reach this full marathon goal, even if it takes another three years instead of three months.

",1,"10-14 hours/week","1) Company had just in sourced applications, It was totally new to me, i had a requirement to enhance it-- to remove the  middle ware component and make it work as normal.
Challenges were unknown infrastructure, Unknown design & data flow, unknown impact. 

I( along with my team) worked day and night to make it work just as normal without the middle ware component. Tried everything we could think of. Got ideas from high skilled folks. But it didn't work.My leader almost lost hope and stopped the decommission of the middle ware component but i still kept trying to make it work. With every failure, my spirit went up high to make it work. I can now proudly say my perseverance paid off. 




2)While pursuing my Masters- MCA(Part time). My work didn't permit me to make some time for education . Failed a couple of times. but my determination to complete my masters was so high that i studies post my work (night time). Walked a few extra miles, worked hard for a few months.

",1,"More than 20 hours/week","One of the roughest periods of my life was the summer of 2014. Fresh out of college 6 months prior to the beginning of 2014, I had jumped at the first job opportunity that presented itself to me as a Supply Chain Leader Trainee role for Damco Distribution Services in Baytown, Texas. There wasn’t much introspection going on as I mulled over the offer, I only thought about how sweet the paychecks would be. It was absolutely a cash grab. You see coming off of 4 years of being a broke college student, the thought of steady income was the pinnacle of success. But what I thought I was signing up for versus what the job actually entailed couldn’t have been more different. I thought I was going to coming into a 3rd Party Logistics Warehouse Facility to improve the operation from an analytical sense. Evaluate the operational efficiencies of our labor workforce and being afforded the opportunity to be creative with the proposed solutions. In hindsight, it was extremely naïve and somewhat entitled on my part. The job actually entailed me having to be at the warehouse at 3 am and leaving around 2pm Monday through Friday, to captain a team of General Laborers to unload containers and then load the correct items into the containers on the opposite side of the cross dock facility. There was little to no job satisfaction and unfortunately that seemed to show through in my short time there. The Operation was having a down year and they chose to let me go in July that year, after 6 months.  It definitely wasn’t the end of the world, as my parents allowed me to move back in with them in my hometown of San Antonio. However, the environment at home was fairly stressful due to my father being laid off earlier that year as well. I was helping out with the bills at home and my well was starting to run dry. Financially it was the toughest time of my life, and I couldn’t help but feel down on myself for failing my family. Perseverance and faith led us through that time, and we grew incredibly close during that stretch. By September, my Father and I had embarked on new careers with a newfound perspective and appreciation for life’s ups and downs. It was a rough time indeed, but it was exactly what I needed.

I was exemplary in Math throughout my life. I like the logic behind coding, and feel like my problem solving, and creative abilities would shine with this background. I really want to learn how to use large sets of data to actually learn something and then use what I have learned to make decisions that will positively affect a company. I am very much into sports, and like the idea of the analytics community using data from the actual game play to engage in predictive modeling.

We decided on Table Rock Head Trail. We picked the trail for its location next to Napa Valley, for its different terrains/environments - rocky, wet and grassy. We soon realized that we did not know exactly where we were going because the trail was not clear cut. We also quickly discovered how limited we were in water and food. And on top of that, as we were going through the trail, we were right ahead of an enthusiastic pair of mountain bikers, who almost crashed into us. As the sun continued to beat down on us, things started to look bleak. Though, we pressed on because with one more step, we knew we were almost at the top of the mountain we were climbing. And when it seemed like I could not remain standing anymore, I had just enough strength to make it to the top of the peak and reach the summit! And the challenge was fully worth it in the end because I was able to bask in the beautiful view of the Napa Valley as I ate my sandwich. 

In the same way, coding takes perseverance. Before heading into a programming assignment, there are expectations of completing it in a certain amount of time, such as in an hour. Quickly though, the hour turns into four hours. And this is to develop elegant code that automates some procedure in order to cut down costs. The vision of elegant code quickly becomes cloudy when I lose steam in trying to figure out some run-time error. My eyes start glazing over and noon soon becomes midnight. Then somehow, I pinpoint the error not in a run-time error, but in a syntax error. The last four hours were due to a misplaced semi-colon! The program eventually runs smoothly and executes. And this feeling very much parallels the thrill of reaching a summit though there was difficulty/delay in achieving success. It just took some determination and grit!","[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",2,2,2,1,2,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I am coming from a background in Genetics. In 2000, President Clinton announced that the Human Genome had been mapped. This was exciting news for me because I thought about all the information packed inside genes that could finally be decoded in meaning. Before graduating from college, I took an upper division Genetics course called “Genomics and Bioinformatics”. It seemed like a futuristic “GATTACA” kind of experience. And in some ways, it was. The class/professor left me fascinated, enamored, thrilled with how computers were making sense of billions of DNA code--in seconds. This led me in wanting to pursue an advanced degree in Bioinformatics. I talked to my professor who taught the above-mentioned class. He said I needed to be familiar with Unix, programming and Statistics to start as a Bioinformatician. Through some research, I found out that Data Scientists used the same tools, but more so in a business context. 

I have been getting increasingly fascinated with business strategy/analytics. I have realized the power of data science. It can be applied in many contexts from figuring out which drug works best for cancer patients, to determining how best to allocate natural disaster resources and to predicting the best gift for that special someone.

I believe the training I will receive as a data scientist will be very valuable in many contexts. Most of all, discovering meaning in big data whether it be in a hospital patient’s records or to decipher a teenager’s Instagram, SnapChat data in order to automatically determine the best gift for her, brings out a lot of hidden meaning behind big data that could automate a person’s decision-making process. 

Given the in-depth analysis and breadth of application in being a data scientist, I am excited to be trained up as one to help uncover valuable meaning in data.","2016-12-13 05:54:22","2016-12-15 07:47:02",a6b2220f38

",1,"10-14 hours/week","One of the biggest projects in my business analytics role with the Memphis Grizzlies was implementing a CRM system within the Ticket Sales department. The software, among many things, would allow the department to better track sales interactions and customer data which could then be used for statistical analyses and modeling. In addition to providing these statistical insights, I was tasked with training the sales staff on new day-to-day processes that would optimize data collection. The challenge I came to face was that many of these users did not see value or incentive to using the new system, as they felt these efforts detracted them from accomplishing their sales goals.

I took tactical actions to persevere through this mindset by continually providing data stories to the department and promoting an open data culture. Presentations rich with visualizations explaining new findings gave users insight to their efforts and started conversations on how to become more data driven. Creating an open forum to discuss at a high level my efforts around prospect scoring and customer segmentation gave users tangible examples of how their data was helping drive ticket sales and retention strategy. These efforts weren’t easy, as it challenged me to always consider my audience when preparing to deliver information and to build strong narratives around my findings, skills that weren't necessarily taught in school.

In addition to new data driven insights, my perseverance led to greater adoption of the system and changes in operational efficiency within the department. Overall, I learned from this experience more of the soft skills needed in a data science position, and that without the proper narrative and buy in around data efforts within a business, new analysis might not be as effective or well received.
","[Significant] I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",3,4,3,2,1,"[Significant] I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.","I want to be a data scientist for three main reasons: to scale my skills and toolkit to work with big data, to use math and statistics to solve today’s biggest problems, and to position myself to contribute to the highly collaborative open source community. 

Gaining more exposure to advanced machine learning techniques and the breadth of big data tools are my biggest areas of opportunity. I enjoy building new tools and working through challenging data problems, and I feel it is critical at this juncture, as the world continues to exponentially accumulate data, to set myself up with the appropriate skills to work with this new information.

I am well-versed in statistics and programming, and believe strongly that some of the biggest problems of my lifetime will be answered leveraging these skills. I am fascinated by many recent real world applications of data science, from its role in guiding targeting strategy in the most recent U.S. presidential election, to the new discoveries being made to find a cure for cancer. Data science is at the center of innovation and decision-making and I want to be in the thick of it. 

Finally, I identify with the characteristics of the data science community in wanting to create an open source culture that encourages continual learning. In May 2015, I was fortunate enough to attend and present at Open Data Science Conference East in Boston to share work I was doing at the Grizzlies with R. This conference was my first exposure not only to the array of open source tools and the evolving big data landscape, but also to the collaborative nature of the data science community. I was in a room full of very similar people speaking the same language, and knew right then that this is where I wanted to take my career. Since this first exposure, I have taken more steps to surround myself around this community, from moving to Boston to learn from the strong data science community, to working on projects with data scientists in my new role at Liberty Mutual Insurance. 

I feel Springboard's Career Track program is the next step forward in my career path towards data science. If selected, the program would be receiving a highly motivated individual who is excited about growing his skills in the field and ready to work hard.

Seeing this need, I took it upon myself to learn two computer languages (despite having no computer science background), and innovated an analysis pipeline to analyze whole-genome data. Learning to code without any prior coding background was difficult. I persevered by learning from books, online-courses, and reaching out to experts to double check my analyses. When I was confident with my pipeline, I analyzed publicly available guinea pig sequencing data, and used these analyses to successfully convince my supervisor to spend over $10,000 on sequencing. As a result, my ability to analyze information and communicate recommendations has led to my supervisor spending over $50,000 on sequencing for multiple projects that I now lead. My ability to analyze this data has provided us crucial understanding of how our treatment affects over 12,000 more genes than we were previously able to investigate, increasing the impact of our work by giving us insight that will guide future experiments in humans.

From the scientific perspective, specific to my experiences, I have been able to process many Gb of data, that when not processed are meaningless, but when processed allow us to understand how brain development is affected after environmental exposures. The most exciting part of big data science for me is the big data enables us to understand how a multitude of factors affect an outcome, and then we can use that understanding to predict how the outcome will respond or change if the contributing factors are modified. The ability to predict how a system will respond, to me, is truly exciting.  ","2016-12-16 19:57:29","2016-12-16 20:38:42",3e01443721

One install was very difficult due to the product not being tested properly and there were hardware components that were incorrect.  The pharmacy managers were upset that they paid so much money for a device that wasn't properly setup and started to question the integrity and professionalism of our company.  To fix the situation, I had to take apart the majority of the machine just to reach the incorrect component and manually remove a link in a chain.  Removing the link and putting the machine back together took a full day of work.  Not only did I restore confidence in the customer, I also worked 12-14 hour days to make up for the lost time and show them that our company was willing and ready to do whatever was necessary to keep them happy.","[Average] I sometimes write code to solve problems in my work.",2,1,2,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","Data science is the field that brings all of my areas of interest into one.

I like the idea of creating scripts and programs that help solve real-world problems and want to help drive business forward.  In my spare time, I have developed programs for a friend to improve his job duties at IBM.  I am a kid at heart and really enjoy games and puzzles.  The act of puzzle solving is both challenging and rewarding.  At my previous job, I enjoyed going through data to figure out why a motor failed or if a certain feature in our custom software was being utilized.  I am also tenacious; if I don't know an answer, I will research and try out many different scenarios until I find it. Finally, probabilities fascinate me. Whether it's playing games or learning about real-world situations, I enjoy determining the best outcome for a situation at hand. It can be that I have a 33% chance to roll a 1 or 5 that I need to win a game, or based on the data that I have in front of me, a company's best option is to pro-actively replace a motor before it causes machine down-time.

When I was working for a Colombian investment bank in 2015 I was given the task of providing overall economic industry reports to investment bankers on different industries. The nonspecific nature of the project made it a difficult task to move through vast amounts of quantitative and qualitative information. How I overcame this challenge was by breaking down information based on the economic scope of qualitative or quantitative information. By categorizing information as macroeconomic or global, sub-macro economic or regional, and microeconomic, I was able to build a thorough outline for different types of economic research, regardless of the industry. It put different industry's nonspecific economic activity into something more tangible for investment bankers to understand, as well as making cross industry comparisons more specific.

My activities these days include soccer, volleyball, hiking, and snowboarding. I also participated in additional organized sports when I was younger.

The thought of a more open-ended approach that applies to a wide range of fields intrigues me. Once I run several simulations, the results can then be used in a variety of ways, including being integrated into the aircraft simulator or used to aid design decisions. Rarely do I use the generated data for anything. I like the idea of leveraging data collected from multiple sources to answer complex questions.

I am also fascinated that the algorithms in use are generic enough that they can be applied to such diverse problems. This opens the door for more creativity than my current engineering position affords me. The problems I solve at work, while very difficult to model, are nevertheless defined by well-understood fluid dynamics equations. The algorithms used are approximations of the physical world used to make a difficult problem more manageable. Given enough computational resources however, the problem could be modeled exactly. In data science, the algorithms are used to simulate unknown systems. Data scientists don't always know what they will discover, and I find that element of mystery alluring.","2016-12-16 20:50:07","2016-12-16 23:11:31",3d78e8a843

Although neatly aligned with the overall mission goals and likely to lead to better results, utilizing this resource was not without risk and would necessitate a different mode of working. The challenge I faced was in convincing both the military unit and my home headquarters that this was the best course of action and worth the initial work in establishing it. Perseverance was required as there were many hurdles, all of varying nature; legal, policy, technical and just plain reluctance to alter tried and tested methods. 
I separated out the various areas of difficulty rather than being overwhelmed by the overall size of the challenge. To keep momentum in the project I tackled easy quick wins concurrently with longer term and more complex problems. This kept up my own perseverance and also demonstrated interim progress to my own leadership. I also enlisted the support of those I was rotating the post with to ensure that the project did not get stale or fall by the wayside when I was not physically in person to keep pushing it. This brought in fresh ideas to tackling the various problems and also a boost to morale through the teamwork itself. The perseverance paid off as once all hurdles were overcome, the resource was tested and its efficiency and value easily proved by the results it gave. Team effort was then pushed in this direction for future rotations.","[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",2,1,1,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","My previous work has involved working with many large and unique data sets each posing its own particular problems and opportunities too. I have always enjoyed the challenges of this and the accompanying need to learn new techniques and tools to successfully analyze and draw valuable insight from the data. Through my own work and that of colleagues, this has also given me lots of insight into how this can be done well and how it can be done badly. 
Outside of work, I have followed with keen interest the developments being made in the growing field of data science and how its application has become more commonplace across varied industries. Although I have been fortunate in my job to be able to rely upon the support of many technical experts, this has also had the adverse effect in that it has personally left me with plenty of gaps in knowledge and in practice that I now hope to fill. I wish to continue my career outside of the government working with and analyzing data, but require training to give some rigor to my previous work experience and also to professionalize my outside interest in this field.","2016-12-19 23:20:14","2016-12-20 01:59:32",5987a806ac

I had a great enthusiasm for the programming. I put additional efforts in learning Java which helped me securing my first job as software developer. Initial 6 years I have worked on application development mainly in manufacturing domain. Slowly I developed interest in banking and financial services domain. I found difficulty to get any projects in the financial services domain since I had already spent some amount in learning the manufacturing domain and every opportunity I received was in the manufacturing domain. The opportunity available for me in the financial services domain was similar to the people without any work-experience. Then I considered myself to equip with the necessary domain skills. I decided to pursue my masters in management full-time with specialization in finance. This was a difficult decision for me to leave a full-time job and go back to school. I was optimistic and took the decision. I put my hard-work in learning the essentials of finance and operations to leverage my manufacturing domain experience and applying it to the financial services domain. After successful completion of masters in management I got successful in getting a job in one of the top private of the bank of the country in their payments team.

Being an Asian American raised in the state of Maryland, I had limited opportunities to learn and practice the language outside of family. As a result, my capacity to understand the language was limited at best. The first time I realized the need to understand the language was when I met my grandparents. Despite my best efforts, I was only able to respond with simple phrases. I thought overcoming the language barrier should be my responsibility as the grandchild. This pivotal moment sparked a four year struggle to learn the language.

As with learning any new language, there is a written and spoken component. I started with a Chinese 101 class in college despite a heavy workload. This class was instrumental to my path on learning the language because I found others like myself who were trying to learn for the same reason. Having regular access to a teacher who could make corrections avoided fixing bad habits later. The second approach was brute force – learning by exposure. I watched movies, read the news, and made notes of tricky nuances. I realized my efforts were paying off because when given the opportunity I would proudly speak in Cantonese. Today I realized the magnitude of this accomplishment because it opens doors for travel and even job opportunities that I could not have imagined years ago.

When studying to be a chemist, I found myself interested in multidisciplinary fields because that had the greatest concentration of applied sciences rather than theoretical discussion. While working as a chemist, processing data seemed to be an arcane subject where it was left handed off to bio-statisticians. Moreover, data science provides tools to solve problems in all sorts of backgrounds. Data science encompasses some of my specific interests such as gene sequencing in addition to problems of different scope such as machine learning or natural language processing. The second aspect of why I want to be a data scientist is because the role turns extremely technical analysis to a story understandable by layman. I find the process of obtaining data and reasons for using a given data set equally fascinating as the analysis. Even though the role of a data scientist is not well defined, I firmly believe the skills obtained from this path will greatly benefit my future career goals.","2016-12-26 06:06:00","2016-12-26 07:21:51",7185676404

The most difficult project within the past month was building a model to properly create strats/portfolio statistics for portfolio allocation to maximize ROI and minimize risk.

The second portion of difficulty was understanding Structured Finance product such as debt facility to properly build model accordingly.  With each of our 4 product lines having at least 300 pages of structuring mechanism and the difficulty of understanding cross-default triggers, I was able to work through this difficulty within a couple of weeks.

When I first started courses I enrolled in an Intro course in computer science. I had never before touched a computer. To be honest I struggled a lot with the course. I was discourage from continuing with computer science due to my lack of skill programming so I moved onto physics. 
In a funny turn of destiny I ended up doing computational work for my first physics research project. This new environment helped me become more comfortable with computing to the point that I started going to computer science courses again. Four years later I am part of a program that teaches high performance computing. I myself, mentor students in the courses I struggled so much with and am now working as a contributor to data science volunteer projects, and other open source projects.

I was given the task of building some basic statistical models to help an online bookstore categorize books that were not selling. They were mostly interested in getting their data organized and helping them categorize their inventory. The major hurdle was the team had no knowledge data analysis or any tools for doing this work.
I broke my job into separate tasks. I first taught myself the basics of R and MySQL as I needed to retrieve data off their closed platform, store that data, and then build analysis off this data. I needed open source tools to complete this task.  I then built a database to land the data that I needed. Finally, I built a set of reports using R and knitR to give the business the information they desired.
I was able to do all this with little help from a senior partner. This was a challenge for me as I was fresh out of school and did not have any mentor to get guidance or advice on how to approach the problem. At every set back or problem, I needed to find solutions myself and consult various books and online resources to solve the problems.

I want to join a program to help me review my skills and find a position that will have the mentorship and development to help me grow my skills. I love the challenge of solving problems with data and want to work on a team that allows for grow and development of the entire team across the data science process.

I had to work with many members of the team to compile data, seamlessly integrate different data sets i(often messy) into a CRM, develop dashboards for reporting, communicate insights to sales teams and senior management and more.  There were some missteps, bouts of frustration, a lot of hand-holding and team meetings, but in the end it was rewarding.

During the first quarter I was inevitable to be considered and became verified to load all 150 munitions that out base loaded across the two jets I worked on. The next quarter we qualified to compete and trained everyday after duty for an additional three hours. This lasted for three months.

 The load was announced as being 3 bombs and 2 missiles on the a-10. The a-10 was still the weakest jet for me and the competition was 2 weeks away. We continued to train after duty and I stayed after so I could work on my own part of the load extra. 

The competition was timed, had an accompanying written exam and uniform inspection. The crew with the highest cumulative score and shortest time won. My crew, aside from me, was seasoned and the crew we were competing against had won three previous years together. They were the favorite to win that year as well. However we won and I became the first airman to compete in my first eligible quarter and receive a perfect score.

Whether it be designing a new graphic or automating R scripts to run on as a scheduled task at the office overnight, the key ingredient to success has always been perseverance (and lots of googling!).

As a local organizer, I had an opportunity to refine my management experience and build a team of 70+ volunteers from the ground up.

Despite the unexpected, disappointing results of the Presidential election, I was proud to have worked on a challenging question for the Hillary campaign: how do I recruit, train, motivate, and retain the greatest number of volunteers, with no pay. After participating in phone banks for almost two weeks, my analyses showed that we had very low rates of conversion from cold calling potential volunteers— just 0.90% of calls resulted in volunteers joining the campaign.  Worse yet, phone calls were consuming valuable time that could otherwise be spent training more callers, or establishing institutional partnerships with community leaders and local organizations (churches and labor unions, etc.)—critical channels for volunteer-recruitment. Despite the campaign’s preference for phone banks, I hypothesized that an email and digital marketing campaign would dramatically improve our efficacy by using other channels to target the members of our database. Taking the initiative upon myself before work and during my lunch breaks, I used email-engagement data and I retargeted users across other platforms including Facebook and Google Voice.  From the start of the new cross-channel campaign until Election Day, I saw my entire volunteer base more than double every week. After sharing my findings with my colleagues, I also helped them design similar campaigns that nearly doubled their volunteer bases, which then allowed them to focus on other high-yield activities like training more volunteer leaders. Despite the Republican landslide in Ohio, our team’s precincts went Blue, in part because I recognized an opportunity to move away from more time-consuming, minimal-impact tactics and instead focus our efforts on a highly scalable, digital tactics.

After working as a story editor in Hollywood for a couple years, I decided that I wanted to transition into a more challenging career in web development. I started saving up and studying Ruby 15+ hours a week while continuing at my full-time job in hopes of quitting and getting accepted into a selective web development bootcamp in San Francisco. 

Once accepted, I invested 70+ hours a week for 3 months learning full-stack web development (primarily Ruby / JavaScript / HTML / CSS). Due to my not having any STEM background (apart from the college-level courses that I'd taken in high school), I felt that I had to work twice as hard to make half as much headway as my very talented and intelligent peers.

On the flip side, data science also holds the power to widen the gap between the technologically literate and illiterate and exacerbate long-standing injustices. As the saying goes, machines are just as biased as the people who program them.

",1,"More than 20 hours/week","When I was a Drilling Engineer for Occidental Petroleum Corporation, I was tasked to plan and execute a drilling project in a newly acquired field. I distinguished this as a challenging project during execution phase of the intermediate section (midpoint of project). The first bit that was planned for the intermediate section of the well was deemed damaged after drilling only 10 FT of hole. Therefore for the second bit I tried a new approach with different drilling parameters. Still no progress, therefore I consulted with drilling specialists and conducted extensive research online to utilize a bit with a different design for the third attempt. Additionally, I consulted with other engineers on this problem to gather their recommendations on drilling parameters. With the newly designed bit, additional research, and recommendations from peers and specialists, the third bit did make drilling progress. The intermediate section was completed with the third bit and I achieved a solid understanding of lessons learned for this field. In addition, I learned that undertaking something new may require the help of others, a new approach, and hard work.

I believe that the hallmark qualities of perseverance are persistence and endurance, which is how I would describe the long journey of transitioning from friend zone to soon-to-be married fiancé. 

We had been good friends who had fantastic chemistry with each other, and naturally, this drew the curious attention of all our friends. Our natural, playful banter led to our friends instigating us to get into a romantic relationship. We played off their failed instigative attempts so well that they eventually stopped. Six years of this well-maintained had passed and one day, I was suddenly swept away to rural Oregon by my parents.

It wasn’t until I experienced the absence of her that I realized I had strong, very strong and romantic feelings for her. But what could I possibly do while I was 1000 miles away? I decided to shelve these feelings and let it stand the test of time. In the meantime, I would focus on my personal growth. 

Three long and dreary years had passed for this sunshine-loving California boy, and finally he returned to his hometown in California with severely sun-deprived, paled skin and a glorious mane that rested on his shoulders. 

The first mission that I had was to say hello to my fondest female friend. We had kept in touch periodically over the phone and saw each other annually during the holidays, but that was as far as our interactions would go. It was maintenance at best. Now, that I was here, and here for good, I was ready to make the moves I had prepared over the past 3 years. But I was in for a shock. A shock that would send me into emotional, teary-eyed mood swings for the next 3 long months. She was seeing someone. 

My heart sank. I cried. I didn’t eat or sleep for days at a time. I contemplated enlisting for the military very seriously, because as far as I knew, my life was over, and there was nothing left for me in California. But I decided no. I decided that this was not the end and that hope was still alive. I decided that the friend zone was not okay with me. I decided that this guy was a jerk even though I didn’t personally know him and that I would confess to her my true and time-proven love. 

We were on the 91 freeway, and I sat in her passenger seat. We were joking around as usual, and I decided that it was now or never. I locked the doors. 

“What are you doing?” she asked softly. 

I replied, “we need to talk. Are you scared?”

“Umm, yes… you know that I get nervous whenever some says ‘we need to talk’.”

“Good, because I have something to tell you. And when I say this, I’ve thought and wrestled this through, and everything I say, I am completely 100% sure of. Are you ready?”

“Now I’m really scared…”

“I like you.”

“What?”

“I like you and want to be with you. Can you stop talking to that guy now?”

“Wait, what? Are you serious?”

“What did I just say 4 sentences ago? Of course, I’m serious.”

“Well, umm… I don’t know what to say to that.”

“Take some time to think about it and let me know. I’ll be waiting.”

“What if I want to see where it goes with this guy? Will you wait?”

“What? But he’s a jerk. Screw him.”

“That’s not fair! You never even met him.”

“No, you’re not fair!” I yell out teary-eyed with nowhere to go because I locked the doors and we were in the middle of the 91 freeway. We sat in awkward silence for the next 15 minutes until she dropped me off at home. 

For the next month, we tried to maintain a normal friendship, but with all the confessions that were made and my daily weeping sessions, I could not bear the burdens of constantly seeing the one who was daily breaking my heart. We slowly stopped seeing each other. But then my birthday was coming up. 

I was torn. Do I invite all of my friends, who are mutual friends with her, but her? Would that be too obvious and messed up? Or do I invite her, be cordial when we greet each other, and then avoid her the rest of the night? I decided on the latter, hoping it’d be just that, but we all know how alcohol likes to work.

Once the booze started kicking in, we started talking and bantering just like the old times. A diminishingly sober part of me was saying that this was wrong, but I silenced that voice with another drink. For just this one night, I enjoyed it as if everything went back to normal. It was very nice.

The next day, I woke up with a pounding headache, and even worse, a heavy heart at the realization that last night was a sham. I met with her later that day to say that I could not see her for a while. I told her that I would still wait for her to give me a firm and solid no and that I would not give up until she told me those words. The distance would do us good as it would give me time to somewhat recover, while it would give her the space to think. She was sad and cried, and I cried too as I drove away. Even though it wasn’t goodbye, it felt like it to the both of us. 

About a month had passed, and one day, I saw on her Instagram that she was really sick with the flu. I asked her roommate if that jerk was doing anything for her, and her roommate said no. I took this as an opportunity to show her how caring and thoughtful I was, and brought her favorite boba drink to her house. She thanked me in the gravelliest voice I had ever heard and she passed out on her couch for the next 2 hours, which I spent reading. Upon her waking up, she said, “I’m hungry.”

“Let’s eat then,” I replied. We went to eat black soybean noodles, which to me was the oddest thing to eat while sick, but she enjoyed it. We went back to her apartment after and she sipped on her now lukewarm boba and thanked me. I said, “you could have all this and more” and left. 

That moment rekindled our friendship back to a normal state, and we started seeing each other regularly again. Little had I known that the jerk and her did not work out, and she was actually scoping out the possibility of us moving forward into a romantic relationship. 

One day, ironically, I was driving and she told me “we need to talk.”

“What!?” I replied. I looked at the doors and saw that they had been locked. “No! I know what this is, and I am scared. I don’t take no as an answer!” 

“No, we really need to talk. I’m serious.” She answered.

“Fine, but you can’t say the word ‘no’ in this conversation.” 

“Henson, I gave it some thought, and I think we should give it a shot. I think it’ll be really good.”

“You’re not saying no?”

“No.”

“Wait, so no or no to you’re not saying no?”

“No to not saying no.”

“So, then it’s a yes? It’s a YES!? YES!!!!!!!!”

So after 3 long years of enduring through obscurity, jeopardizing my closest opposite-sex friendship, and heart-wrenching hardship, I successfully jumped from the friend zone to the boyfriend zone. Fast forward a year and half later, we are now engaged to be married in 10 months. I believe I have accomplished the most impossible feat known to man, literally a man and not woman, and it was only through perseverance, persistence, and endurance. Now that I have accomplished an impossible feat, anything is possible as long as I commit my heart, body, and mind to it. 

Whenever tasked with mountainous objectives, I say this to myself.

“How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.”

My foundation for Data Analytics was laid during graduate school where I have learnt modeling uncertainty through Monte Carlo Simulations, analyzing data using Bayesian Decision Framework, Pivot Tables, Regression Analysis and ANOVA. My curiosity to learn Big Data Analytics led me to learn Python and Java programming languages, set up Hadoop cluster in Linux OS,  and process large data sets using various components of Hadoop ecosystem such as MapReduce, Hive and Spark.","[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",2,1,3,2,1,"[Significant] I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.","My foray into Data Science has been systematic and gradual with continual learning of the relevant fundamental concepts and acquiring the tools required. I am a math enthusiast since schooling and I chose a quantitatively intensive education. My Project Management Master’s degree at The University of Texas at Austin strengthened my analytical skills and introduced me to predictive modeling and risk analysis on large data sets. The Data Science Bootcamp is the logical culmination to this pursuit in bridging the gap between my skillset and the lack thereof.

Since 2013, I have been working in business development on capital budgeting, resource allocation and risk analysis of supply chain projects where I develop best alternative solutions using optimization techniques. In 2014, I stumbled upon Data Science while brainstorming a technology start-up idea. Though the start-up did not materialize, I realized the importance of drawing insights from large data sets that are available in businesses these days for informed decision making. That drove me to learn Python, Java and Big Data technology and my passion to delve further has grown even higher.

To gain the skills in topics such as machine learning and data visualization, I am convinced a structured learning program is essential and now is the right time. This comprehensive and accelerated online program fits my needs perfectly. I believe that my GMAT quantitative score of 50 and my education credentials demonstrate my quantitative aptitude that is required for this bootcamp.  With my acquaintance with Python programming language, I can surely pick it up to the required level at faster pace than a beginner.

The multi-disciplinary skill set needed to evolve into a quantitatively trained coherent story teller is what I intend to gather from Springboard's Data Science Bootcamp. ","2017-01-08 04:29:26","2017-01-08 05:11:04",5d7e1ed4ff

While I expected to learn new experimental techniques and adapt the technology platform of the company, I had also signed myself up for learning (from scratch) how to write scripts in R to analyze all the research data I was generating in lab. The challenge lay in the project deadline --two months from my start date. 
     I enrolled for an online course but soon realized that the best way to learn and apply R quickly was to use my data set as a project. This approach helped me focus my learning on what would be most applicable to meet the project deadline. It is an approach that has helped me overcome similar challenges throughout graduate school. Also, when I came across a roadblock, I reached out to coworkers who were more experienced and their input was always invaluable. Through working diligently, keeping an open mind to suggestions from experts, and pushing through failures, I was able to meet the deadline, and write R scripts that our entire team has found beneficial for their data analysis ever since.

In doing so, I came to realize that the challenge of learning and applying R to analyze data was the most fulfilling part of my job. 
      A second reason for my decision to transition to a full-time data scientist career is the versatility of the skills that will offer the opportunity to impact diverse areas of research.

It assumed prerequisites I did not have and covered areas of mathematics wholly foreign to me, such as the stability theory of dynamical systems and discretization of partial differential equations. Furthermore, all of the mathematical content was delivered and evaluated using proofs, which I had no previous exposure to. I had to quickly learn how to write mathematical proofs, get myself up to speed on differential equations (through online resources and asking engineers for advice), and learn a new programming language, though the last was not especially difficult since I had already taught myself C++. Despite the very steep learning curve of this course given my background, I received an A.","[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",3,2,3,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","A few years back, anxious to convince a nascent animation studio that its first animated feature stood a poor chance of turning a profit unless it had a much stronger screenplay, I taught myself how to run a regression analysis and performed it on all non-sequel, English computer-animated films, examining the relationship between their Rotten Tomatoes scores and inflation-adjusted box office. Among the many surprising findings, the correlation between critical reception and box office was rather strong (r = .7) and became significantly stronger (r = .98) when the population was limited to the first film of each animation studio. Satisfied that my argument now had an empirical basis, I wrote a six-page report and sent it to the studio. That first foray into statistics opened my eyes to the powerful notion that words are not the only means by which we can tell stories or share insight. I yearned for more, but there was just one problem: I was a musician.

My exposure to both statistics and programming began during my time in Beijing working as a film composer. Near the end of those five years, I became increasingly dissatisfied with freelance composing for hire. At the same time, my interests in both programming and statistics intensified; I taught myself C++ to code my own chord progression generator and music theory quizzes, and spent more time reading FiveThirtyEight articles than screenplays. I needed to change careers to pursue these new interests in statistics and programming, and the intersection of both attracts me to advanced studies in data science.","2017-01-10 18:10:09","2017-01-10 18:28:53",a9113ab819

Cicadas were chanting relentlessly. And the cornfields were releasing even more steam on such sauna days. 
I was leading this team of first year graduate students from China agricultural university to conduct surveys regarding farmers’ management practices and yield of maize.  It was not an easy survey. We had to first find the fields that I chose according to satellite images, and then to find the farmers who managed this field. Sometimes, we were lucky to already have a local village official that came with us to the field and gave us a list of names according to our chosen field. Most of the time, we had to wait next to the field for our ‘local guide’ to come. And sometimes there weren’t even any guide. 
It did not take long before I received complaints from my fellow team members. Those grad students on my team were going back to the university in 30 days, and it would be even less likely for me to complete the survey by myself. Often, those perspective graduate students were hiding under the shade next to cornfields, wiping off sweats from their faces, while I tried to identify field locations. They did not care about interviewing farmers or collecting data, as they were simply following the ‘commands’ of their professors.
I was facing extreme heat, an exhausted team and a tight schedule. Collecting this survey data was crucial to my PhD thesis, and I was determined to finish it regardless of circumstances. I decided to analyze our process flow to resolve the bottleneck-- finding the field and the farmers.
I decided to change our survey schedule in alignment with farmers’ routine. Instead of surveying throughout the day, we now conducted interviews from 9 to 11 when farmers were home eating brunch. After our lunch, my team would take a nap in the van when I went to find our next targeted field and to identify the corresponding farmers.  Then my fully rested team surveyed again during the farmers’ dinnertime.  This new schedule better utilized our time and allowed the team to rest more without compromising our productivity.  With more surveys completed per day, the moral also improved in the team. As a result, 200 surveys were completed within the one-month time period.

1.	I enjoy problem solving and overcoming new challenges
2.	I want to work on projects with a shorter time frame than typical academic projects
3.	I am equipped with many of the skills required for a data scientist

My college degree was in math, and I have always enjoyed solving challenging logic related problems. Going into my PhD, I was applying my modeling and statistical skills to solving food security and environment related problems. They were new challenges and I made a significant shift from math to earth science. 
It was an enjoyable experience. One thing I learned about myself was that I was yearning for more frequent feedback in my work and a faster turn around of projects.  As opposed to working on a project for 2-3 years, I want to work on projects that could be finished within a few months if not shorter. 
Becoming a data scientist will allow me to work on shorter projects in fields that are novel to me.
Both my undergraduate and graduate education have prepared me with coursework and experiences in statistical analyses such as machine learning algorithms using R as well as spatial analyses using Python and Google Earth Engine. There is still a lot to learn, and I look forward to the potential opportunity of enrolling in Springboard.

So, I asked my mentor to explain about it. After receiving his understanding, I started implemented the method using Excel.

I have been translating complex processes to Spanish for my parents since I was kid (e.g. mortgages & leases); I had to support my mother as the ""man"" of the household when my father passed away in high school; and I succeeded in acquiring my bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering without any precedent to do so. I have been an adult since I was a child. I have acted as a father figure to my siblings since I was a teenager. I have financed my education and nurtured my success without external support. Rather than let the stress and inexperience inhibit my drive toward success, I used those challenges as additional reasons as to why my success was so crucially important - for myself, my family, and others facing similar challenges. I have no intention of stopping now. If anything, I am more confident I can handle the challenges that await me in the future. ","[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",1,3,2,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I started my education in biomedical engineering with the intent to design medical devices. While in college, I was exposed to the research environment for medical applications, and I found myself more interested in the data rather than the devices used to collect the data. Medical imaging, biochemical fluctuations, and sensors collecting all sorts of information - all of this was data. All of this had some potential value if the right insights could be extracted. At the time, I lacked the skills to do anything more than gather basic statistical insights, but I was always thinking of how I could use this data to do something more. In hindsight, I was thinking about data science, but I didn't know it: I hadn't yet been introduced to the concept. 

I decided data was the route for me. I used my master's as an opportunity to pivot to a degree more aligned with my interest in data and its analysis: I pursued a degree in industrial engineering. I enjoyed learning more about statistics, designing experiments (DOE), and running simulations using different probability distributions. I felt I was closer to acquiring a career more involved in data analysis. 

Upon graduating with my master's, I joined Intel full-time as an industrial engineer in Intel's supply chain rotation program. The rotation program allowed me to try four different job roles within supply chain, and decide my final placement. My intent was to go through my rotations and select the position most involved in data analysis. Although I have identified a rotation involving data analysis, it's not as intensive nor as analytical as I would like. I hope that as I progress through Intel I can find a role more suitable for what I'm looking for.

Intel introduced me to the concept of data science. With applications in artificial intelligence, big data, and the tech industry in general, Intel enlightened me about the wealth of data available across numerous (nearly infinite) applications/platforms. I started keeping up with current events on tech and data, which introduced me to the concept of data science and its importance in a world with ever-growing amounts of data, our capacity to store it, and the ease with which to access it. 

I was inspired to learn more and really develop my skills in data science, so I enrolled in Springboard's Introduction to Data Science course. I learned how to use R to scrub, wrangle, and analyze data. I used techniques like k-means clustering and text mining to derive information from a large dataset. I loved the entire experience and enjoyed learning how to do something I am growing increasingly passionate about. I want to continue learning more, and I someday land a career in data science.

I am approaching my career mid-point and felt very stagnant in my professional development. My challenge wasn’t for me to simply get a new job, but to assess and carve out a new career direction and begin to “skill-up”. So I did. I stayed with the same employer and looked to move laterally and internally into a role where I could safely develop new skills and domain expertise. I considered the inventory of all posted internal roles I’d be eligible for as well as assess the groups who delivered Change management (my area of expertise) for a business line or internal service I was less familiar and more quantitative based subject matter. I networked with targeted groups to be among the first batch of candidates hiring leads would consider before posting a new position. Fortunately, I was successful in my networking approach to move into the change management group charged to deliver projection models that will illustrate to US regulators how this firm’s capital would be impacted to a range of adverse economic scenarios. While I was not on the quantitative strategy team who defined and built these models, the exposure to Python, R-code, the mechanics to create and implement a statistical model, is what I sought out.

There is no instruction list for this so I had to use lots of improvisation in order to make parts fit and to ensure the chair had an element of stability. Through trial and error and two (almost full) rebuilds I realized that the legs of the chair would have to be wooden but that the arms, seat, and back of the chair could remain as hockey sticks but only if the hollow core of the composite sticks were filled with wood. I had to cut small precise slivers of wood to fit each stick. This was all done in a college dorm room my sophomore year and I had to outsorce for tools using Colby's Physical Plant Department, spending many hours in their warehouse using nonoptimal  tools to complete the task on a college budget.
Once completed, I kept the chair in my room until one day it was stolen from me. The theft, not knowing the sentimaental value I had for this chair was unlucky to meet me 2 months later when I finally knocked on her door (having gone door to door for 2 months looking for this chair).

He needed me to write a program that could use Amazon's Product Advertising API to gather pricing and sales rank data. Since I had been using Python for other, simpler projects, I  agreed to the task, but I had never learned how to use an API outside of those explained in various books. I knew this program would take some patience to get working, so I set off to make my first custom script to make use of an API I was not familiar with. 

The hardest part (by far) was to get my first request working. It took me a solid few days to figure out what the 400 error represented, and no outside resources were helping. I must have Googled 30+ different questions to see what was going wrong with my request. I couldn't even find anything on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) developer forums. I was down, but I was not out! Then, seemingly out of nowhere, I came across a forum that pointed out that all US requests have to come in with a current UTC timestamp within 15 minutes. Living in San Diego, my computer is set to PST. I set my computer to UTC and my next call to the API was successful.

Today, this program pulls any information I want, for any product, out of this API, and loads the data into an SQLite database. I learned a lot from this first venture into unknown API territory, but the most important thing was learning that I have the power to be able to solve difficult problems. With enough willingness to explore, try different solutions, and learn in the process, I can answer the questions that need to be answered.","[Significant] I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",3,2,1,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I want to be a data scientist for the following main reasons:

2) Data science is the practice of helping real people solve real problems using data and facts. In other words, data scientists need to be able to solve problems within a business context. I want to be able to use my undergraduate, finance education in conjunction with programming knowledge to solve real, meaningful problems.

3) Data science requires the use of many different technologies that are constantly changing. I have a real passion to learn and work with new techniques and technologies as shown in my recent project work.

I have the capacity to learn all the skills required to become a true data scientist, and have carefully created a curriculum in order to do so.

Drugs, gang violence, and graffiti have always tried to force themselves into my life. In several cases I almost became involved in drugs and graffiti due to the fact that most of my close friends were actively involved in both, and had become drug users and vandals. So I decided to pick up a sport and I choose skateboarding; it created a barrier which helped me avoid drugs and graffiti, and guided me on a path in which I led the way. I wanted to become a role model for my friends who also dealt with the pressure of drugs and graffiti in their lives; so instead of reaching for a pipe or spray can I reached for a skateboard. Skateboarding became my outlet; it allowed me to calm down when I was stressed and or had too many things on my mind; it physically tired me out and at the same time helped clear my mind. It kept me occupied, and out of trouble. In academic courses such as physics I excelled due to the fact that I was able to relate to the concepts through first hand experiences. Skateboarding also enhanced my characteristics; it enriched me with confidence, motivation, determination, intelligence, leadership, and self-reliance. Skateboarding motivated me in school, because I put the mentality of having patience, maintaining dedication, analyzing the problem, and establishing a goal; I then applied it directly to my academic studies. If it were not for skateboarding I would have most likely chosen the same downtrodden path as my friends.
	One of the many problems that lied within the city of Pacoima was the absence of a local skate park. In my sophomore year I was enrolled in a Computer Assisted Design technology class. I learned how to use the computer program CAD and Google sketch; with these programs I designed many projects. On my own time I designed a flatland skate park. I wanted there to be a violence and drug free zone where anyone could skateboard so I submitted my design to the California Skate Parks Company, and they said that some of my designs were going to be implemented in the creation of the skate park. This changed my perspective on life; it allowed me to realize that I can use academics and technology not only to better my life, but to set examples for younger children and my peers by giving back to my community. Skills that I value indefinitely such as my imagination and ingenuity to design skateboarding obstacles with limited resources; I acquired from skateboarding and applied them to my academics. I used the limited resources my high school had to offer and with them created a safe zone which skateboarders now call their second home.
	Growing up in a rough neighborhood such as Pacoima has changed my method of thinking as well as my perspective on the way I view society. It has allowed me to realize that success in life comes easily with an education but I need to utilize all of my resources. Skateboarding has led me to new and prosperous pathways, by helping me grow into a creative and self-reliant individual. I pride myself as an innovator that with my leadership skills and unique mindset will use a higher education to re-model my community into one that supports and values education along with making it a safer place to live. 
","[None] I have no experience programming in any full-featured programming language like R, Python, Java etc.",1,1,1,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","Being a data scientist would mean everything to me. When I was in college I wanted to pursue an engineering degree, but compared to the competition I was far behind not because I did not study enough, but because they already had taken most of the courses in their high schools, which were not offered in my high school and therefore set the curve. I ended up switching my major in order to graduate. After graduating I felt like those four years were a waste of time and I want to go back to school and study in something tech related but hardly any schools offer a second bachelor's. So I decided to learn on my own because I know I can and I know what I want to learn and that is data science. I enjoy statistics and calculus and want to put those skills and passions to good use. I love to learn new things and have been learning to code in SQL for the past couple of weeks. I hope this program will fully teach me the basics  of data science in order for me to confidently pursue a career as a data scientist and at the same time help me land my first job in the technology/business industry that I research everyday.

I would try to use any opportunities like social events and group discussions that came along in daily life to overcome my fears. Though I found it uncomfortable and difficult at the beginning, I was determined to overcome it and ready to put in the effort required. Later I took up a job as an instructor at a local tutoring center for a few months in order to further face my fears and get better at dealing with them. I have been successful in overcoming a large part of my fears and feel confident now.

",1,"15-20 hours/week","A couple of years ago, while I was working with Qualcomm on Salesforce Development, there was a challenging situation of completing the project development (Includes not only configuring but also developing Apex Triggers and few Visual Force Pages), getting QA done and moving to production in just a weeks’ time which was a very tight deadline for the project. Me, my manager and another senior member are only three of us working on the project. On second day, project was half way through and my manager had to leave on emergency and not sure on his turnaround time. My Senior whom I thought will be helpful was struck on production issue for next two days on another implementation. The situation was very insane with lots of pressure from the management that we cannot postpone the deadline and thus I had to handle the project all alone and meet the deadline at any cost.
 On top of time constraint and non availability of teammates, I ran into access revoking issues (my access being revoked due to refresh activities - another half a day almost got wasted in getting back my access), with environmental setups and getting permissions, collaboration among teams in sharing business requirements, taking responsibility of my managers and senior team mate work  I slogged for next 5 days including weekends with very little sleep or no sleep and made my project success. As am struggling to finish, a lot of emotions peeked in, was angry, confused and exhausted etc. But I found that burst of energy within myself to cross the finish line just by being focused, patient and sticking to working on the project. Throughout the project, I was committed and moved forward with positive attitude and won accolades from my manager, senior team mate and management as well.

And what products are trending? But little did I know then that those are the ways to collect data and enable a full text search on “Big data”. Following that I began to hear buzz words data science and analytics around the corner and I began to explore it reading blogs and articles online. My interest in the field grew with respect to time and I started my Masters where I was Introduced to R programming, Big data Architecture, Business management and various other courses which helped me gain a 360-degree view of the filed. 
From my experience above, I understood that data science allows us to make informed decisions, provides objective answers to satisfy curiosity and can be applied across any domain. Thus, my learning from the fascination earlier has made me eager to become Data scientist. In the process of satisfying my eagerness and interest I wanted to pursue this Springboard Career track program.

Resume
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5ErcyAq8sgxWDVrRG5RdXZFaHc",1,"15-20 hours/week","A New Yorker my whole life, I was very much out of my element my first year out of college living in the Mid-west. I made it into Nestle’s operational management 5-year training program and my first year task was to work in Wisconsin at one of their largest US factories supporting the different teams and learning about Nestle’s operations structure at a factory level. It was very much a “sit here and do what we ask you to” position.
 
My first couple months went by, and it felt like each day I would learn about a process, routine, structure, or report that seemed to infuriate the factory team. I wanted to take each one and try and correct them, but being a young new-grad from NY did not give my ideas much credit in the eyes of seasoned employees and superiors twice my age. However, one day I was asked to sit in on a big meeting to learn more about decision making at the factory’s leadership level. On a bi-annual basis the factory leadership would review the “Loss Analysis Report”. This report reviewed the factory’s losses by analyzing all aspects of the facility’s performance verses its original plan for the year. From this the leadership team would then adjust their KPI’s and tackle new projects that would aim to eliminate the greatest identified losses. 

I was really impressed with the data and the decisions that were being made, but I asked why only do reviews like this at such a high level and only twice a year? I found out that this report took over a month to put together though massive efforts by members of each department to find, organize, combine, analyze, and visualize all the different loss streams. I thought there had to be a better way! I began to talk more with each team that contributed to this report and realized I could design an automated system that would do this data wrangling and analyzing much faster and easier. I explained my proposal to my boss and with the promise of a much simpler process with much more flexible reports that allowed deeper analytics into identified issues, I was able to secure a small team of people who would work with me to provide the necessary data streams and departmental contacts to make this a reality.

Over the next 5 months I worked with each department of the factory, (operations, safety, finance, quality, engineering, utilities and HR) to standardize their process for tracking and storing their loss data. Each department was very hesitant to listen to this inexperienced “new guy” who wanted to change how they did things. The more they realized that what I was doing would save much of their team’s time they were eager to give me access to whatever I needed to make this work for them. I did this project as an addition to my training objectives, it was not what the program intended for me to do but I was determined to bring this system to life.

Finally, I managed to get all the pieces together. Each department’s data pipelines were standardized, training documentation was written for each group showing how to analyze their data and submit it to the final report, and a new “super user” was trained to bring it all together with the automated system I created in Excel that allowed for the final report with custom visualizations to be generated in just a few clicks. I presented the new system to the senior leadership team who was not expecting to really use this “tool” some new guy created. They finally saw that this system delivered on all the promises I made, and the presentation turned into a discussion on how can this system be used across the entire factory down to the production line level teams to review their own performance and empower them to make their own KPI’s to meet quarterly goals.

Although I was met with resistance throughout this process, I knew this was something impactful I should do. In the end, it not only impacted the business but helped employees evaluate their performance and how they could improve it through analyzing their own data.

To me there is a thrill in understanding how to take seemingly unrelated data and uncover the relationships that really cause an impact and create the systems that help predict what can happen next. I have been working to develop the right skills and expand my mindset to take real world problems and find how data can be part of the solution. I want to keep building these skills and work with a team of likeminded people who are all focused on solving challenges with data and understanding how that data really makes an impact.

I have seen the power a data driven solution can have on people and their business objectives and know right now we are only scratching the surface of what is possible and want to be a part of the future breakthroughs the data science community will create.

Although I was born and raised in the states, I struggled with the language due to my arrogance. I believe I just needed the bare minimum to get through life and essentially college.  I did not realized how important it is until I attended college. After failing one English course after another, I thought maybe college isn't for me as many courses rely heavily on reading and writing. That being said, I persistently tried to improve with the the help of one of my professors through tutoring sessions, writing labs, and grammar courses. I finally saw my hard work paid off when I was rewarded with an A in Advance English Composition and many courses after. Although it doesn't seem like much of an obstacle for many, it is a great achievement for myself especially when I looked back on all the D's and C's.

When I started working as a Business Analyst, I was very comfortable interacting with various clients from the Finance industry, since I have a fair amount of domain knowledge.
However, I had no exposure to the world of software engineering, since my experience was predominantly from the domain of Finance. With no formal training in any of the programming languages, I used to feel out of place to begin with.
But I decided to address the root of the problem instead of giving up and started learning Python and SQL. In parallel, I also started learning about software engineering methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, etc. 
Within 3 months, gradually I started picking up the development jargons and developed a good working relationship with the developers too. In fact, after over a year into my job, I was the one to suggest  my team to try Kanban methodology for one of the projects, which with some friction was accepted by the team in a pilot mode, eventually switching to Kanban, for most of our projects.
On the other hand, my enhanced SQL skills empowered me to get business insights based on the data and prepare more effective reports for my clients and other stakeholders.
Overall, thanks to my perseverance, I am doing well in my current job, and in fact now aim to take the next step of becoming a Data Scientist to make the most of my analytical skills.","[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.",3,1,3,1,1,"[Significant] I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.","Having worked as a Business Analyst for over 2 years, specializing in the financial domain, I started having an urge to know more about the business side of running a business too. That's when I decided to start my own venture, wear2xpress.com, a customized apparel startup, primarily targeting the Indian market.
While I have been working on formulating the business strategy for my venture, I had to make many decisions, like which t-shirt patterns to use, which colors would be more in demand, how do we ensure we reach our target audience, etc.
We hired a consultant to conduct surveys and help us make these decisions. I realized the power of data and what impact it can make on any given domain, when I was working with this consultant.
This led to my decision to learn the in and out of Data Science, so as to empower myself to make sense out of the raw data.
In today's world, data science is not limited to a single domain. So, I want to learn this science, in order to get ready to embrace data in my future endeavors.","2017-01-16 08:25:17","2017-01-16 09:22:15",b86b073860

Suddenly the program was working and I spent the rest of the semester fine tuning the design and the interaction with Dr. Pinto's R code from the back. Designing the Front End for LORACS taught me that stubbornly plodding forward on a project is not always the most productive method to solving a problem in computer science. Collaboration and leaning on the wisdom of those who have already blazed the trail helps lessen the development burden and leads to expedited results.","[Average] I sometimes write code to solve problems in my work.",3,2,4,2,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I already do Spatial data science in my work as a GIS Coordinator, but I want to take my statistics and programming skills to the next level.

I find that I don't really enjoy the work that's been provided to me so far, as there isn't as much tinkering with CAD and general problem solving as I thought there'd be. However, I did find that I enjoyed the Data Analysis part of my job, and I do like the concept of taking data to quantify implicit concepts or ideas. Not to mention that Data Science, Data Analysis and Software Development seem to be a much more varied and spread out career option than my current field.

",1,"15-20 hours/week","In the fall of 2014, I moved to Boquete, Panama to teach English. While the work was  rewarding, it was extremely difficult at first. Not only was I teaching students with varying levels of English comprehension simultaneously--from those who spoke conversationally to those who struggled with basic grammar and vocabulary--but I also had to teach them largely in Spanish--my second language.

Though somewhat demoralized, over the next three months, I made strides in my ability to teach. And many of my students made great strides in their English abilities as well. One student in particular improved vastly. At the beginning, Naila could only read English, having learned it on the internet. She had a lot of difficulty learning how to recognize and pronounce words out loud. Suffice to say, Naila at first did not have much confidence in herself, or belief in her goal of going to a college in England or the United States. Every class though, we would work diligently to improve her conversational skills.  Some classes we would watch videos and discuss what was going on. Others we would simply have a conversation about ours days. However every class she became a little more confident, and by the end of the three months, she had an ability to speak and understand certainly at a level to attend an English-speaking college. While much of Naila’s improvement fell on her own hard work, I am proud of myself that I stuck through a teaching situation that at first seemed truly daunting, yet in the end actually made someone’s life better.","[Average] I sometimes write code to solve problems in my work.",2,2,3,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I want to be able to interpret data at a professional and intuitive level. To be perfectly honest, having just graduated college one month ago, I do not know exactly what profession I want to go into. However, it has become increasingly clear to me that data science is an ever more essential part of business, law, and academia. This is not to say I do not have more specific dreams however. Whether I end up mulling over evidence for a court case, examining the statistics of a shortstop in a baseball front office, consulting non-profits on their fundraising, drawing research conclusions in a history graduate program, advising musicians on their online exposure, or something else entirely, I am not sure. What I do know is that I want the quantitative skills to understand the world around me no matter where my life takes me. ","2017-01-24 18:48:24","2017-01-24 20:28:29",60fe77b0ac

Human behavior, or intrinsic motivation, is incredibly unpredictable, and you simply cannot escape it. I think constantly; day and night; about why a person does what they do, and wonder if their behavior would be statistically significant across a population. I want to find ways to quantify and understand why people are motivated to do one thing over the other, and justify human behavior with hard data. This can feed heavily into the biomedical and public health sector, which falls in line with my Bachelors of Science in Bioengineering.

Being unemployed and low on cash, I needed my car to attended interviews and networking events. I had no other option, no matter how slim the odds, but to search and find my car. The short version is: I used my laptop to look up crime maps near my house on Trulia and jump in a truck with my dad and brother to search the highest crime zones. After an hour of nerve-wracking, morale wearing toil, we find it. Recalling it now, it's also a very practical use of data-driven bayesian thinking.

The night after it happened I wrote it up as a short story and shared it on facebook. Here's a copy if you want to read the full dramatic version:

This is primarily due to two factors: exponential growth in data collected on everything, both more people using ever smaller devices and the emerging internet of things; secondly, machine learning algorithms that can extract meaning from the data to make predictions and guide decision making. 

The potential for good, bioinformatics in cancer research, and harm, possible racism in crime recidivism algorithms, is great; I'd like to be on the side of making sure the massive amounts of information collected on all of us is to our benefit as much as possible.
