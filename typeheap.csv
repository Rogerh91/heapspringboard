I wanted it to be a practical data product that created real-world value.  For the project, I scraped a dataset of historical UFC (professional mixed martial arts) fights, and developed a predictive model.  In total I spent close to 4 months wrangling and cleaning data, testing the model, adjusting the model, then testing and adjusting again... all of this work being done alone (with some guidance from my excellent mentor, Goran).  Today, I've been using the UFC data product to bet on UFC fights every week since September, and it's producing consistent financial returns.  I've also recruited my brother (a software developer), and another friend (product scientist at Medium) to further assess betting strategies through Monte Carlo simulations, as well as to further automate the weekly dataset updates and upcoming fight predictions.","I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",2,3,2,2,2,"I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","In a word, it's enjoyable.

My proposal received good scores that fell slightly short of the marks for award, but it had promising odds of funding if I submitted a revised proposal to respond to critiques. However, the review process is subjective and at times unpredictable, and the revised proposal unexpectedly received a worse review. In combination with decreased federal research budgets, my project was now unlikely to be funded for the foreseeable future. Because my proposed faculty job at UCLA depended on this funding, my job was very much in doubt. This was a frustrating situation after spending nearly 7 years in graduate school and fellowship with the goal of acquiring a faculty job. 

To hedge against this possible outcome, I had begun networking with colleagues at other universities about my research and opportunities to collaborate or join their groups. After receiving the unfavorable news on my grant proposal, I stepped up my efforts to pitch my research ideas and market my unique skills and interests in statistics, hoping to land job offers elsewhere. These efforts led to two competing offers, and I accepted a faculty position with a role in statistical analysis and data management for a group of researchers at UC San Diego. 

Even though I was now at a different university, I continued to push for my proposal to get funded, as this would be the first building block in establishing my own research program. To overcome the barriers created by my move to a new university, I pursued many phone meetings with busy administrators at the funding agency, acquired new mentors at my new university, and retooled my proposal to argue my project would be strengthened by my new institution. My proposal was ultimately funded, nearly 2 years after the original submission. ","I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",2,3,2,1,1,I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.,"I have always been fascinated with questions of “why”, such as learning the underlying reasons why people make certain decisions or why certain events happen. This instinct led me to a PhD in psychology and a research career to identify the underlying causes of self-defeating human behavior, like substance abuse. However, unlike many researchers who learn basic statistics and then outsource their data work to others, data analysis is my favorite aspect of the research process, and one that I cannot envision giving up. For me, data analysis is the core of research, because data is the only evidence we have to test our ideas or answer our questions. In a sense, the data is all that matters. Unlike most researchers, I’m more obsessed with improving my technical skills than in becoming an expert in a particular field or topic. Data science fits this trait as it provides an endless domain for mastery of new techniques and innovating new approaches to solve data-related problems. For me, the most stimulating task I encounter in my job is being presented with a new question about data, and having to design a creative way to approach the data to answer the question. This is a secondary or occasional task in my job as a researcher, but will become my primary role when working as a data scientist. 

My decision to leave academia to pursue data science is also motivated by differences in the purpose of data in these respective fields. In academia data often isn’t used with an actionable goal in mind. Data produced by research studies are typically published in journals that are consumed mainly by other researchers, and data rarely drive actions at the clinic or patient level. In contrast, practical data science is more often used to provide an actionable recommendation. In reviewing the typical roles of data scientists, I desire such an action-oriented role where data have more immediate impact for guiding an action. In academia I also find that ingrained conventions or theories are deeply resistant to change even when confronted with conflicting data. Scientists go to great lengths to “bend” the data to fit their original hypothesis or idea. I prefer a career where data is used more objectively as feedback for nimble adjustment of a process or goal. Data science is also used in a way that creates value for an organization, a decision-maker, or a consumer. My work in academia has lacked this emphasis on adding value, which I see as a more satisfying use of data and a necessary component of my career.",2016-11-16 23:41:18,2016-11-16 23:43:00,ff0772bfda,7336800234434269,,150040,Chrome 54.0.2840,La Jolla,United States,Desktop,www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track,Windows 7,http://mkto-ab200069.com/kF08M0T006001L7fQ00Z10K,California,DSCWorkshop,,email_WO,DSC_Strong_List_New,,2016-11-11 13:43:25,2017-01-26 17:09:00,17ycgvz9ev157,https://www.springboard.com/schedule/kane-li/,kane@springboard.com,Kane,Kane Li,1000,103,2017-01-02T08:00:00+00:00,http://dscareercommunity.springboard.com,https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track/learn/,US/Pacific,24,,Matthew,,,,"Develop strong expertise in common programming languages, including Python and R.

However, I've reached a point where I feel that biomedical engineering, and medicine in general, needs a new forcing function. This thought occurred when I was at a conference for personalized medicine and saw great opportunity in creating devices that adapt to not only patient, but also the physician. However, there are problems with this vision that I think data science can solve.
First, the value provided by patient-specific devices and medicines is hard to determine, but a little less hard with more data. This is a non-linear, multivariate, problem that will change how we apply medicine, from treatment of complex acute diseases in the developed world, to the treatment of people in developing countries. Second, the cost of medicine in countries like the USA are so random and unregulated, that it's no wonder that the USA has the highest spend on healthcare per capita than any other nation, but with less than average outcomes. 
Those are professional reasons. Personally, I have known that my kryptonite as an engineer has been complex coding projects. I've developed code that's worked well enough, or had my hand held to the finish line, but now I really want to dive deep into making applications and programs on my own, and in teams.

I didn't understand some of the material I had missed in my math class (Calculus II). I considered dropping the class and taking (Calculus I). I chose to stay in the class and find a way to complete it so I sought out tutors and spent a lot of time searching for learning resources online to gain a better understanding of the material. 
When the week was over I had managed to complete all the work from all my classes that was overdue.

We decided on Table Rock Head Trail. We picked the trail for its location next to Napa Valley, for its different terrains/environments - rocky, wet and grassy. We soon realized that we did not know exactly where we were going because the trail was not clear cut. We also quickly discovered how limited we were in water and food. And on top of that, as we were going through the trail, we were right ahead of an enthusiastic pair of mountain bikers, who almost crashed into us. As the sun continued to beat down on us, things started to look bleak. Though, we pressed on because with one more step, we knew we were almost at the top of the mountain we were climbing. And when it seemed like I could not remain standing anymore, I had just enough strength to make it to the top of the peak and reach the summit! And the challenge was fully worth it in the end because I was able to bask in the beautiful view of the Napa Valley as I ate my sandwich. 

In the same way, coding takes perseverance. Before heading into a programming assignment, there are expectations of completing it in a certain amount of time, such as in an hour. Quickly though, the hour turns into four hours. And this is to develop elegant code that automates some procedure in order to cut down costs. The vision of elegant code quickly becomes cloudy when I lose steam in trying to figure out some run-time error. My eyes start glazing over and noon soon becomes midnight. Then somehow, I pinpoint the error not in a run-time error, but in a syntax error. The last four hours were due to a misplaced semi-colon! The program eventually runs smoothly and executes. And this feeling very much parallels the thrill of reaching a summit though there was difficulty/delay in achieving success. It just took some determination and grit!",[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.,2,2,2,1,2,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I am coming from a background in Genetics. In 2000, President Clinton announced that the Human Genome had been mapped. This was exciting news for me because I thought about all the information packed inside genes that could finally be decoded in meaning. Before graduating from college, I took an upper division Genetics course called “Genomics and Bioinformatics”. It seemed like a futuristic “GATTACA” kind of experience. And in some ways, it was. The class/professor left me fascinated, enamored, thrilled with how computers were making sense of billions of DNA code--in seconds. This led me in wanting to pursue an advanced degree in Bioinformatics. I talked to my professor who taught the above-mentioned class. He said I needed to be familiar with Unix, programming and Statistics to start as a Bioinformatician. Through some research, I found out that Data Scientists used the same tools, but more so in a business context. 

I have been getting increasingly fascinated with business strategy/analytics. I have realized the power of data science. It can be applied in many contexts from figuring out which drug works best for cancer patients, to determining how best to allocate natural disaster resources and to predicting the best gift for that special someone.

I believe the training I will receive as a data scientist will be very valuable in many contexts. Most of all, discovering meaning in big data whether it be in a hospital patient’s records or to decipher a teenager’s Instagram, SnapChat data in order to automatically determine the best gift for her, brings out a lot of hidden meaning behind big data that could automate a person’s decision-making process.

EDUCATION
Bachelor of Science Degree in Statistics

June 2012
University of California, Davis
",1.0,10-14 hours/week,"One of the biggest projects in my business analytics role with the Memphis Grizzlies was implementing a CRM system within the Ticket Sales department. The software, among many things, would allow the department to better track sales interactions and customer data which could then be used for statistical analyses and modeling. In addition to providing these statistical insights, I was tasked with training the sales staff on new day-to-day processes that would optimize data collection. The challenge I came to face was that many of these users did not see value or incentive to using the new system, as they felt these efforts detracted them from accomplishing their sales goals.

I took tactical actions to persevere through this mindset by continually providing data stories to the department and promoting an open data culture. Presentations rich with visualizations explaining new findings gave users insight to their efforts and started conversations on how to become more data driven. Creating an open forum to discuss at a high level my efforts around prospect scoring and customer segmentation gave users tangible examples of how their data was helping drive ticket sales and retention strategy. These efforts weren’t easy, as it challenged me to always consider my audience when preparing to deliver information and to build strong narratives around my findings, skills that weren't necessarily taught in school.

In addition to new data driven insights, my perseverance led to greater adoption of the system and changes in operational efficiency within the department. Overall, I learned from this experience more of the soft skills needed in a data science position, and that without the proper narrative and buy in around data efforts within a business, new analysis might not be as effective or well received.
","[Significant] I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",3,4,3,2,1,[Significant] I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.,"I want to be a data scientist for three main reasons: to scale my skills and toolkit to work with big data, to use math and statistics to solve today’s biggest problems, and to position myself to contribute to the highly collaborative open source community. 

Gaining more exposure to advanced machine learning techniques and the breadth of big data tools are my biggest areas of opportunity. I enjoy building new tools and working through challenging data problems, and I feel it is critical at this juncture, as the world continues to exponentially accumulate data, to set myself up with the appropriate skills to work with this new information.

I am well-versed in statistics and programming, and believe strongly that some of the biggest problems of my lifetime will be answered leveraging these skills. I am fascinated by many recent real world applications of data science, from its role in guiding targeting strategy in the most recent U.S. presidential election, to the new discoveries being made to find a cure for cancer. Data science is at the center of innovation and decision-making and I want to be in the thick of it. 

Finally, I identify with the characteristics of the data science community in wanting to create an open source culture that encourages continual learning. In May 2015, I was fortunate enough to attend and present at Open Data Science Conference East in Boston to share work I was doing at the Grizzlies with R. This conference was my first exposure not only to the array of open source tools and the evolving big data landscape, but also to the collaborative nature of the data science community. I was in a room full of very similar people speaking the same language, and knew right then that this is where I wanted to take my career. Since this first exposure, I have taken more steps to surround myself around this community, from moving to Boston to learn from the strong data science community, to working on projects with data scientists in my new role at Liberty Mutual Insurance. 

I feel Springboard's Career Track program is the next step forward in my career path towards data science. If selected, the program would be receiving a highly motivated individual who is excited about growing his skills in the field and ready to work hard.

When I was working for a Colombian investment bank in 2015 I was given the task of providing overall economic industry reports to investment bankers on different industries. The nonspecific nature of the project made it a difficult task to move through vast amounts of quantitative and qualitative information. How I overcame this challenge was by breaking down information based on the economic scope of qualitative or quantitative information. By categorizing information as macroeconomic or global, sub-macro economic or regional, and microeconomic, I was able to build a thorough outline for different types of economic research, regardless of the industry. It put different industry's nonspecific economic activity into something more tangible for investment bankers to understand, as well as making cross industry comparisons more specific.

I am also fascinated that the algorithms in use are generic enough that they can be applied to such diverse problems. This opens the door for more creativity than my current engineering position affords me. The problems I solve at work, while very difficult to model, are nevertheless defined by well-understood fluid dynamics equations. The algorithms used are approximations of the physical world used to make a difficult problem more manageable. Given enough computational resources however, the problem could be modeled exactly.

Being an Asian American raised in the state of Maryland, I had limited opportunities to learn and practice the language outside of family. As a result, my capacity to understand the language was limited at best. The first time I realized the need to understand the language was when I met my grandparents. Despite my best efforts, I was only able to respond with simple phrases. I thought overcoming the language barrier should be my responsibility as the grandchild. This pivotal moment sparked a four year struggle to learn the language.

As with learning any new language, there is a written and spoken component. I started with a Chinese 101 class in college despite a heavy workload. This class was instrumental to my path on learning the language because I found others like myself who were trying to learn for the same reason. Having regular access to a teacher who could make corrections avoided fixing bad habits later. The second approach was brute force – learning by exposure. I watched movies, read the news, and made notes of tricky nuances. I realized my efforts were paying off because when given the opportunity I would proudly speak in Cantonese. Today I realized the magnitude of this accomplishment because it opens doors for travel and even job opportunities that I could not have imagined years ago.

When studying to be a chemist, I found myself interested in multidisciplinary fields because that had the greatest concentration of applied sciences rather than theoretical discussion. While working as a chemist, processing data seemed to be an arcane subject where it was left handed off to bio-statisticians. Moreover, data science provides tools to solve problems in all sorts of backgrounds. Data science encompasses some of my specific interests such as gene sequencing in addition to problems of different scope such as machine learning or natural language processing. The second aspect of why I want to be a data scientist is because the role turns extremely technical analysis to a story understandable by layman. I find the process of obtaining data and reasons for using a given data set equally fascinating as the analysis.

I was given the task of building some basic statistical models to help an online bookstore categorize books that were not selling. They were mostly interested in getting their data organized and helping them categorize their inventory. The major hurdle was the team had no knowledge data analysis or any tools for doing this work.
I broke my job into separate tasks. I first taught myself the basics of R and MySQL as I needed to retrieve data off their closed platform, store that data, and then build analysis off this data. I needed open source tools to complete this task.  I then built a database to land the data that I needed. Finally, I built a set of reports using R and knitR to give the business the information they desired.
I was able to do all this with little help from a senior partner. This was a challenge for me as I was fresh out of school and did not have any mentor to get guidance or advice on how to approach the problem. At every set back or problem, I needed to find solutions myself and consult various books and online resources to solve the problems.

I love the challenge of solving problems with data and want to work on a team that allows for grow and development of the entire team across the data science process. 
I want to know more about data at all levels of the process, everything from data storage and engineering up to the building of models and presentation of the results and derived information.

While I expected to learn new experimental techniques and adapt the technology platform of the company, I had also signed myself up for learning (from scratch) how to write scripts in R to analyze all the research data I was generating in lab. The challenge lay in the project deadline --two months from my start date. 
     I enrolled for an online course but soon realized that the best way to learn and apply R quickly was to use my data set as a project. This approach helped me focus my learning on what would be most applicable to meet the project deadline. It is an approach that has helped me overcome similar challenges throughout graduate school. Also, when I came across a roadblock, I reached out to coworkers who were more experienced and their input was always invaluable. Through working diligently, keeping an open mind to suggestions from experts, and pushing through failures, I was able to meet the deadline, and write R scripts that our entire team has found beneficial for their data analysis ever since.

Ever since, I have been doing online courses (EDx, Coursera) to learn skills and write code (primarily in R) for analyzing research data for my current job. In doing so, I came to realize that the challenge of learning and applying R to analyze data was the most fulfilling part of my job. 
      A second reason for my decision to transition to a full-time data scientist career is the versatility of the skills that will offer the opportunity to impact diverse areas of research. As the boundaries across multiple disciplines blur, I feel the universal skills of a data scientist are crucial in bringing collaborative research to fruition.

It assumed prerequisites I did not have and covered areas of mathematics wholly foreign to me, such as the stability theory of dynamical systems and discretization of partial differential equations. Furthermore, all of the mathematical content was delivered and evaluated using proofs, which I had no previous exposure to. I had to quickly learn how to write mathematical proofs, get myself up to speed on differential equations (through online resources and asking engineers for advice), and learn a new programming language, though the last was not especially difficult since I had already taught myself C++. Despite the very steep learning curve of this course given my background, I received an A.",[Limited] I have not done any coding beyond homework for courses I’ve taken.,3,2,3,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","A few years back, anxious to convince a nascent animation studio that its first animated feature stood a poor chance of turning a profit unless it had a much stronger screenplay, I taught myself how to run a regression analysis and performed it on all non-sequel, English computer-animated films, examining the relationship between their Rotten Tomatoes scores and inflation-adjusted box office. Among the many surprising findings, the correlation between critical reception and box office was rather strong (r = .7) and became significantly stronger (r = .98) when the population was limited to the first film of each animation studio. Satisfied that my argument now had an empirical basis, I wrote a six-page report and sent it to the studio. That first foray into statistics opened my eyes to the powerful notion that words are not the only means by which we can tell stories or share insight. I yearned for more, but there was just one problem: I was a musician.

My exposure to both statistics and programming began during my time in Beijing working as a film composer. Near the end of those five years, I became increasingly dissatisfied with freelance composing for hire. At the same time, my interests in both programming and statistics intensified; I taught myself C++ to code my own chord progression generator and music theory quizzes, and spent more time reading FiveThirtyEight articles than screenplays. I needed to change careers to pursue these new interests in statistics and programming, and the intersection of both attracts me to advanced studies in data science.",2017-01-10 18:10:09,2017-01-10 18:28:53,a9113ab819,8485803374364054,,158058,Chrome 55.0.2883,Elmhurst,United States,Desktop,www.springboard.com/,Windows 10,direct,New York,kddscblast,,email,kdnuggets,,2017-01-10 9:18:27,2017-01-26 16:16:41,17ycgvz9ev157,https://www.springboard.com/schedule/kane-li/,kane@springboard.com,Kane,Kane Li,4800,127,2017-01-30T08:00:00+00:00,http://dscareercommunity.springboard.com,https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track/learn/,US/Central,-4,2017-07-30,Derek,,,,"I am applying to MS in Data Science programs this semester.

Cicadas were chanting relentlessly. And the cornfields were releasing even more steam on such sauna days. 
I was leading this team of first year graduate students from China agricultural university to conduct surveys regarding farmers’ management practices and yield of maize.  It was not an easy survey. We had to first find the fields that I chose according to satellite images, and then to find the farmers who managed this field. Sometimes, we were lucky to already have a local village official that came with us to the field and gave us a list of names according to our chosen field. Most of the time, we had to wait next to the field for our ‘local guide’ to come. And sometimes there weren’t even any guide. 
It did not take long before I received complaints from my fellow team members. Those grad students on my team were going back to the university in 30 days, and it would be even less likely for me to complete the survey by myself. Often, those perspective graduate students were hiding under the shade next to cornfields, wiping off sweats from their faces, while I tried to identify field locations. They did not care about interviewing farmers or collecting data, as they were simply following the ‘commands’ of their professors.
I was facing extreme heat, an exhausted team and a tight schedule. Collecting this survey data was crucial to my PhD thesis, and I was determined to finish it regardless of circumstances. I decided to analyze our process flow to resolve the bottleneck-- finding the field and the farmers.
I decided to change our survey schedule in alignment with farmers’ routine. Instead of surveying throughout the day, we now conducted interviews from 9 to 11 when farmers were home eating brunch. After our lunch, my team would take a nap in the van when I went to find our next targeted field and to identify the corresponding farmers.  Then my fully rested team surveyed again during the farmers’ dinnertime.  This new schedule better utilized our time and allowed the team to rest more without compromising our productivity.  With more surveys completed per day, the moral also improved in the team. As a result, 200 surveys were completed within the one-month time period.
","[Significant] I write code regularly for my work or personal projects, and can pick up most new concepts or languages on my own.",2,4,1,2,1,[Significant] I am an expert and regularly use statistical methods for my work or personal projects.,"There are three main reasons:
1.	I enjoy problem solving and overcoming new challenges
2.	I want to work on projects with a shorter time frame than typical academic projects
3.	I am equipped with many of the skills required for a data scientist

My college degree was in math, and I have always enjoyed solving challenging logic related problems. Going into my PhD, I was applying my modeling and statistical skills to solving food security and environment related problems. They were new challenges and I made a significant shift from math to earth science. 
It was an enjoyable experience. One thing I learned about myself was that I was yearning for more frequent feedback in my work and a faster turn around of projects.  As opposed to working on a project for 2-3 years, I want to work on projects that could be finished within a few months if not shorter. 
Becoming a data scientist will allow me to work on shorter projects in fields that are novel to me.
Both my undergraduate and graduate education have prepared me with coursework and experiences in statistical analyses such as machine learning algorithms using R as well as spatial analyses using Python and Google Earth Engine. There is still a lot to learn, and I look forward to the potential opportunity of enrolling in Springboard.

LaTeX is a typesetting language that is used to write various math notations. Every math textbook is written using LaTeX. I have never used it before and homework 1 was due on week 2. So I spent all that first weekend learning the basics of LaTeX and how to properly write up the homework. I managed to finish it in time. Moreover, I got quite proficient at it and ended up using it to take note in class in real time. It was a good investment, because I still have the notes for all my classes from 2 years ago.",[Average] I sometimes write code to solve problems in my work.,3,2,3,1,1,"[Average] I have taken at least one college-level course in statistics, and have a good understanding of concepts such as probability and descriptive statistics.","I have been studying Math for a long time. It is very enjoyable, but I would like to see myself working on something a little more practical in the real world. Of the classes I have taken, Probability and Combinatorics are the classes I enjoyed the most.

Initially, only a 5-page model documentation was shared with us by the vendor. After a couple of rounds of negotiation and meetings, the vendor agreed to share a few more documents regarding their models. But all the documents disclosed to us were still very limited and vague. I then read a great deal of published papers, articles, tutorial and even some blog posts on that subject to teach myself about the key concepts in commercial campaigns and the modeling technique used. Through all the searching, reading and meetings, I was eventually able to complete a report evaluating those 6 models and identifying the risks in them. My report was given kudos by the shareholders.
